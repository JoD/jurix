\begin{abstract}
%The Knowledge Base Paradigm advocates the accumulation of domain knowledge in a formal knowledge base to enable its use for multiple applications.
%This approach induces flexibility and agility, as changes in the domain are reflected directly in the knowledge base, without affecting the algorithms that use the information in the knowledge base.
%Similarly, new ways to use this information can be developed independently of the specific domain and are highly portable.
%This paper demonstrates these characteristics with the case of Belgian registration rights, by modelling it in the \idp knowledge base system.
%The concerned legislation changed considerably mid 2018.  
%Models for the former and current legislation are developed with the knowledge base system \idp.
%The modelled specifications are supplied to a generic graphical user interface, which interactively supports a user to comply with registration right law.
%The resulting interactive decision enactment system derives consequences of user input and signals which unspecified parameters are still relevant under the given input.
Recently, a prototype was developed for an interactive decision enactment system that supports notaries in dealing with the complex Belgian real estate sale legislation. This prototype follows the Knowledge Base Paradigm (KBP): it consists of purely declarative domain knowledge, to which various logical inference methods can be applied in order to perform certain tasks. This paper extends that work in two ways. First, we experimentally  validate the claim that the KBP leads to highly maintainable software, by adapting the prototype to a recent overhaul of the relevant legislation. Second, we extend the functionality of the prototype by a number of additional logical inferences, which allow us to address a number of usability concerns of the notary office. This provides further evidence for the claim that the KBP is indeed a viable method of developing interactive software systems. The resulting decision enactment prototype is a fully generic system, that can be applied to other (legal) domains with minimal effort.
