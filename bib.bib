abstract = {Inductive definitions and justifications are well- studied concepts. Solvers that support inductive definitions have been developed, but several of their computationally nice properties have never been exploited to improve these solvers. In this paper, we present a new notion called relevance . We de- termine a class of literals that are relevant for a given definition and partial interpretation, and show that choices on irrelevant atoms can never benefit the search for a model. We propose an early stop- ping criterion and a modification of existing heuris- tics that exploit relevance. We present a first imple- mentation in MinisatID and experimentally eval- uate our approach, and study how often existing solvers make choices on irrelevant atoms.},
